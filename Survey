Incorporating a new way of interaction by creating 3D imagery which is generated from text based descriptions. The idea is reliant upon the nature of all problems that persist in the world. Each problem in the world can be labelled as a problem of recognition. In this project, the proposed system would intake a string or a set of strings, parse out all the identifiable meaningful units, and build 3D models of the said units. Furthermore enhancing the interaction a step beyond is bringing out animations from the digital 2-D plane to a more responsive and interactive 3-D holographic form. This paper brings various implementations of the said system and technology to limelight and proposes to take a calculated and statistically measured leap into the realm of bridging the gap between communication of a human and a computer system, by practically giving the system a metaphysical 3-D structure.
Introduction:
In an era where each and every aspect of our daily lives is going under an astounding restructuring of https://www.ssla.co.uk/buy/ in the digital plane and automation. Thus this introduces the dire need of communication between humans and machines (computer systems) - which in one way or another represent our daily drivers in the digital dimensions. These interactions are vital as predominantly everything is undergoing digitalization and communication is turning inter-plane. The need to have new interaction modes that progressively ekes the productivity of the said interaction between humans and machines. An integral part of the entire process is to make the interaction as natural as possible, in other words, to make it as intuitive and ingenuine as it can be.
